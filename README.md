During my math class, I had the opportunity to develop an algorithm that generates prime numbers using prime numbers.
While my algorithm for generating prime numbers may not be considered revolutionary, it is still a unique solution that showcases my ability to think creatively and analytically.

### 1. The set $p_k$  contains k prime numbers. 

```math
p = {3}
```

$$a_k $$
